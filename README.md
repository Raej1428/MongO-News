# "Ladies and Gentleman. Can I please have your attention? I've been handed an urgent and horrifying news story and I need all of you to stop what your doing and scrape a news site using this tool!!!... CAAAAAANNNONBAAALLLL!" - Ron Burgundy-esque

Well I suppose it takes all types. Here is something for you then. This news scraper, scrapes all the latest headings from vox.com. And if you love the news, and can't get enough of it, you should visit this page daily and scrape for new news daily!!!

Dependencies:
- Node
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- mongo Shell
- Cheerio
- Axios
- Handlebars (eyeroll)

TODO:
- Working on the correct img src. You see vox has a dynamic image tag which is easy to grab but the img src tag that will actually pull up the img is embedded in a noscript element which will require more code to make that img appear.
- I would like the note functionality to work consistently, so I am improving the code for the note section.
